## Problem Statement :
Developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model with an integrated text summarizer to efficiently extract and summarize key information from unstructured text data.
## Problem Description :
Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies entities like people, organizations, and locations in text, but alone, it may not offer actionable insights. Integrating NER with a text summarizer is crucial for efficiently distilling essential information. The challenge is to build a robust NER model adept at recognizing entities across domains and languages while summarizing them effectively. This integrated solution aims to enhance information extraction, aiding tasks such as document analysis and information retrieval.
